# Extract and Override

This is a classic dependency breaking technique from Michael Feathers' book "Working Effectively with Legacy Code". In this session we learn how to use it on the classic coding problem "TripService" by Sandro Mancuso. Emily Bache has made a video ["Breaking Legacy Code Dependencies with Extract and Override"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwr9bVyXkTY) that explains more and shows a demo using Java.

## Motivation

In Legacy Code we can often times find usages of the Singleton pattern or static method calls to infrastructure functionality scattered around the code. This makes it very hard to try to test these kind of methods. Most of the time, it is not easily possible to change the constructor to inject these services or change the method signature without breaking other code. We still would like to get these methods into a test harness.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe when to use a dependency breaking technique
- Use safe steps to get a method under test with "Extract and Override"

## Session Outline

- 5 min connect: Safe Refactorings for Breaking Dependencies
- 5 min concept: What is a Dependency Breaking Technique
- 10 min demo: Extract and Override
- 35 min do: pair on Trip Service
- 5 min reflect: When should you use this

### Connect - Safe Refactorings for Breaking Dependencies

Make a list of names of refactorings, most of which people should have heard of and know roughly what they do. Ask them to vote for which ones they would feel confident doing without having any unit tests. When everyone has voted, summarize what the majority of people think would be ok. Point out it's about risk. Some refactorings are more risky because you might make a mistake. Some are less risky because they are simpler to get right, or because you have good deterministic tools.

Sample list of refactorings to vote on:

- Rename variable
- Extract method
- Introduce Parameter
- Introduce Guard Clause
- Move Method to another class
- Remove Dead Code

### Concept - What is a Dependency Breaking Technique

Use the chapter from Feathers' book as a basis for presenting what this is.

"Dependency-Breaking Techniques... decouple classes well enough to get them under test"
    -- Michael Feathers, introduction to chapter 25 in "Working Effectively with Legacy Code"

You could mention that there are 24 such techniques listed and today we will look at one of the simplest ones - Extract and Override.

### Concept - Demo

Show the [Trip Service Kata]({% link _kata_descriptions/trip_service.md %}) and how to use 'Extract and Override' to make the code testable. Do a more or less detailed demo depending on how much your audience needs to see before trying it themselves.

More details: Show the `TripService` class and explain that it is hard to test the `getTripsByUser` method, because it uses a Singleton and a static method call, which ultimately may represent an infrastructure call. We would normally mock these kind of dependencies to have a quicker and more focused test without relying on real databases or APIs. We cannot inject those dependencies and do not want to change the external interface of `TripService`, neither the constructor nor the method signature, to safely get our class under test. Then show how to get this class under test by demonstrating the 'Extract and Override Call' pattern.

### Concrete Practice - Trip Service Kata

Give them the goal to test three scenarios for this method:

- Logged user is null
- Logged user and given user are not friends
- Logged user and given user are friends

Ask them to use the 'Extract and Override' technique to achieve that.

Caveats: When creating the testable subclass of `TripService`, there may come a moment, where someone suggests to inject mocked dependencies to the `TestableTripService` class, instead of injecting the user, which should be returned. In this case, you can either let them experiment and choose, which way they prefer or, depending on the time, tell them the way you would approach this.
Generally, you would inject the return values instead of injecting mocks.

### Conclusions - When should you use this

Get people to discuss [when to use]({% link _activities/conclusions/when_to_use_this.md %}) dependency breaking techniques. You could also ask about any drawbacks they see with this particular dependency breaking technique "Extract and Override".
